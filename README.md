# Mystery-Number-Guessing-Game - AWS CLOUD 
This is a simple web-based number guessing game developed in JavaScript. The project was created as a personal learning exercise to put into practice my skills in cloud technologies, specifically using AWS for deployment.

# Project Overview
The game challenges the user to guess a randomly selected number within a specified range. The player receives feedback after each guess, indicating whether the number is too high, too low, or correct. The objective is to guess the correct number in as few attempts as possible.

# Features
User-friendly interface to input guesses.
Feedback on each guess (too high, too low, or correct).
Reset option to start a new game.
Responsive design for optimal play on both desktop and mobile devices.
# Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend/Cloud: AWS (Amazon Web Services)
Deployment
The game is hosted on AWS, leveraging services such as:

Amazon S3: Used to host the static website.
Amazon CloudFront: For content delivery and caching, ensuring fast load times globally.
Amazon Route 53: For DNS management and providing a custom domain.
# How to Play
Open the game in your browser at ""
Enter your guess in the input field.
The game will inform you if your guess is too high or too low.
Keep guessing until you find the correct number!
Once you've won, you can start a new game by clicking "Reset."

# Future Improvements
Adding a difficulty mode with varying ranges.
Implementing a leaderboard to track high scores.
Storing the number of attempts and showing performance statistics.

#Learnings
This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of cloud infrastructure, particularly:

Hosting static websites on AWS S3.
Using CloudFront for fast and reliable content delivery.
Managing domain routing with Route 53.
